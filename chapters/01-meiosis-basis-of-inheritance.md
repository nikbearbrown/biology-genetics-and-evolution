# Chapter 1 — Meiosis and the Basis of Inheritance
*The physical mechanism behind an abstract law.*

---

In 1902, a twenty-four-year-old graduate student named Walter Sutton was sitting at a brass microscope in Lawrence, Kansas, staring at testis cells from a grasshopper.

He had trapped the grasshoppers himself on the Kansas prairie. He had fixed the cells, sectioned them, stained them. The grasshopper species he was using — *Brachystola magna*, the lubber grasshopper — had unusually large chromosomes, large enough that Sutton could count them, distinguish them by size, and watch what they did across consecutive cell divisions in the same tissue section.

What he saw was this: the chromosomes came in pairs. And during the cell division he was watching, each pair separated cleanly — one member of each pair going to each daughter cell. Not two to one side and none to the other. Not a random scramble. One to each side, cleanly, every time. And the orientation of one pair relative to another was completely independent — one pair had no apparent influence on how the other pairs chose their directions.

Sutton knew Mendel's paper. Gregor Mendel had published his pea-breeding experiments in 1866 and concluded that hereditary traits were carried by abstract "factors" that came in pairs, segregated cleanly into gametes, and assorted independently between different traits. Mendel could not see these factors. No one could. They were an inference from counts of wrinkled and round peas, from yellow and green seeds, from the ratios he got when he crossed hundreds of plants.

Sutton was staring at something that behaved exactly like Mendel's factors. And it was visible through a microscope.

He published his conclusion in 1903: Mendel's factors are chromosomes. The inheritance pattern of any trait is the meiotic behavior of the chromosome carrying it. The same year, independently, the German embryologist Theodor Boveri — working from a completely different direction, studying sea urchin eggs fertilized by multiple sperm — concluded that each chromosome carries something distinct, and that specific chromosomes are necessary for normal development. Their conclusions, taken together, became the **chromosomal theory of inheritance**.

Everything in genetics since has been the elaboration of that theory.

## The arithmetic problem

Before the mechanism, the bookkeeping.

A human body cell contains 46 chromosomes — 23 pairs, one member of each pair inherited from the mother and one from the father. These are called **diploid** cells (from the Greek for "double"). When two such cells fuse at fertilization — a sperm and an egg — the resulting cell would have 92 chromosomes. And their children would have 184. Within ten generations, the genome would be unworkable.

Something has to cut the chromosome count in half before fertilization doubles it. That something is **meiosis**: a specialized cell division that takes one diploid cell (46 chromosomes) and produces four haploid daughter cells (23 chromosomes each), each of which can become a gamete.

Here is the bookkeeping, worked out step by step:

| Stage | Chromosome count | Chromatids per chromosome |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Germ-line cell before DNA replication | 46 (2n) | 1 |
| After DNA replication | 46 (2n) | 2 |
| After meiosis I (two daughters) | 23 (n) each | 2 |
| After meiosis II (four gametes) | 23 (n) each | 1 |
| After fertilization (zygote) | 46 (2n) | 1 |

The two columns matter differently. The chromosome count is halved at meiosis I. The chromatid count per chromosome is halved at meiosis II. The two divisions split the bookkeeping in two — meiosis I is the **reductional division** (it reduces ploidy from 2n to n); meiosis II is the **equational division** (it preserves ploidy while separating the two identical chromatids of each chromosome).

For the inheritance argument, almost everything interesting happens at meiosis I.

## Mendel's First Law, in cells

Mendel's First Law — the Law of Segregation — says that the two alleles at any locus separate cleanly during gamete formation, so that each gamete carries exactly one. A heterozygous parent Aa produces gametes that are exactly 50% A and 50% a. Mendel concluded this from counting offspring. He could not say why it was true.

Now watch what meiosis does.

Take a heterozygous Aa parent. In every somatic cell of this organism, there are two copies of the chromosome that carries the seed-shape gene — call it chromosome 7. One copy carries the A allele; the other carries the a allele. The two copies are **homologous chromosomes**: same gene content in the same order, but possibly different alleles at any given locus.

The organism enters its reproductive phase. A germ-line cell begins meiosis. First, it replicates its DNA — each chromosome is now two identical sister chromatids joined at a region called the centromere. After replication, the cell has four chromatids at this locus: two carrying A (the two sisters of the maternal chromosome 7) and two carrying a (the two sisters of the paternal chromosome 7).

In **prophase I**, the two homologous chromosomes find each other and pair along their full length, forming a structure called a **bivalent** (or tetrad, because it contains four chromatids). This pairing has no equivalent in ordinary mitosis. It is the step that makes meiosis meiosis.

At **metaphase I**, the bivalent aligns at the cell equator. Spindle fibers from opposite poles attach to the two homologs — one pole pulling the A-bearing homolog, the opposite pole pulling the a-bearing homolog.

At **anaphase I**, the spindle pulls the homologs apart. The A-bearing chromosome goes to one pole; the a-bearing chromosome goes to the other. The sister chromatids do not separate at this step — they stay joined at the centromere. What separates is the homologous pair.

After anaphase I, the cell has produced two daughter cells:
- Daughter 1: carries chromosome 7 with A (as two sister chromatids still joined).
- Daughter 2: carries chromosome 7 with a (as two sister chromatids still joined).

Meiosis II then separates the sister chromatids in each daughter — essentially mitosis on a haploid cell. The result of one complete meiosis of a single Aa germ-line cell: four haploid gametes, two carrying A and two carrying a. The ratio is exactly 1:1.

Mendel's First Law, in cells. The 50:50 segregation he needed to explain his 3:1 ratios is the cytologically obvious consequence of one homolog from each pair going to each daughter cell at anaphase I. **Anaphase I is the molecular event underlying Mendel's First Law.**

The Punnett square you built last chapter — its two row labels and two column labels being the gametes A and a from a heterozygous parent — is bookkeeping for the products of that one anaphase I event.

## Mendel's Second Law, in cells

Mendel's Second Law — the Law of Independent Assortment — says that the alleles at one locus assort into gametes independently of the alleles at any other locus. Cross AaBb × AaBb and the offspring phenotype ratio is 9:3:3:1. This requires the four gamete types from each AaBb parent — AB, Ab, aB, ab — to appear in exactly equal proportions, 1:1:1:1. Mendel did not know why different traits would assort independently. He observed it across all twenty-one combinations of his seven pea traits and called it a law.

Now watch what happens at metaphase I.

Take an AaBb organism, with the A/a locus on chromosome 1 and the B/b locus on chromosome 2 — different chromosomes. After DNA replication, the cell entering meiosis has two bivalents: one for chromosome 1 (carrying A and a as homologs) and one for chromosome 2 (carrying B and b as homologs). The two bivalents are physically separate structures. They do not interact.

At metaphase I, both bivalents align at the cell equator. Each bivalent independently chooses which homolog faces which pole. Each choice is an independent coin flip. For bivalent 1, the A-carrying homolog faces the left pole with probability 1/2. For bivalent 2, the B-carrying homolog faces the left pole with probability 1/2, independently.

There are four equally likely configurations:
1. A left, B left → daughters get AB and ab.
2. A left, B right → daughters get Ab and aB.
3. A right, B left → daughters get aB and Ab.
4. A right, B right → daughters get ab and AB.

Each configuration occurs with probability 1/4. Averaging across many germ-line cells, the AaBb parent produces gametes AB, Ab, aB, ab each at frequency 1/4. Exactly what Mendel's Second Law requires.

The mechanism is the independent orientation of bivalents at metaphase I. Each chromosome pair makes an independent choice. The choices multiply — because they are independent events — and the four equally likely outcomes are the four gamete types in equal proportion. **Mendel's Second Law is the statement that bivalents orient independently at metaphase I.**

![Two bivalents at metaphase I showing all four](images/01-meiosis-basis-of-inheritance-fig-03.png)
*Figure 1.3 — Two bivalents at metaphase I showing all four*

For n independently orienting bivalents — n heterozygous loci on n different chromosomes — the number of distinct gamete types is 2ⁿ. Each bivalent contributes a factor of 2, and the choices multiply. For humans, with 23 chromosome pairs:

2¹⁰ = 1,024  
2²⁰ = 1,048,576  
2²³ = 2²⁰ × 2³ = **8,388,608**

About **8.4 million distinct gamete types** per human individual, from independent assortment alone, before crossing over is considered at all. This is not 23 × something. It is 2 × 2 × 2 × ... twenty-three times. The independence of each bivalent's orientation is the multiplicative engine.

![Each new independently-assorting chromosome pair doubles the count; the result is multiplicative, not additive](images/01-meiosis-basis-of-inheritance-fig-04.png)
*Figure 1.4 — Exponential growth chart showing gamete diversity vs*

A note on Mendel's luck. He chose seven traits in pea plants, and by luck — or unconscious selection — all seven happened to assort independently. Peas have seven chromosome pairs. Each of Mendel's traits is controlled by a gene on a different chromosome, or far enough apart on the same chromosome to behave as if it were. If he had chosen two traits on the same chromosome and close together, he would have seen non-Mendelian inheritance, and his 1866 paper might have been a much more confusing document. The fact that his Second Law held for all twenty-one pairwise combinations of seven traits was not the rule of genetics — it was a coincidence that let him see the rule.

When the Second Law was eventually challenged by exceptions, the exceptions did not break the chromosomal theory. They confirmed it. Two genes that did not assort independently were on the same chromosome. The exception became a measurement tool.

## When the Second Law fails: linkage

The chromosomal theory makes a sharp prediction Mendel's data could not test: when two genes are on the same chromosome, they should not assort independently. Their alleles should tend to travel together into gametes, because the chromosome they share segregates as a unit.

This prediction was tested and confirmed by T. H. Morgan's group at Columbia University, working on *Drosophila melanogaster* beginning around 1910. And it was turned into a quantitative tool by Morgan's undergraduate student Alfred Sturtevant, who sat on his bedroom floor in Manhattan one evening in 1913 and built the first genetic map of a chromosome.

Here is the argument.

Consider two genes on the same chromosome. Call them A (alleles A, a) and B (alleles B, b). Take a parent heterozygous at both loci, with the A and B alleles on the same homolog — the "coupling" configuration, written AB/ab, meaning one chromosome carries A and B while the other carries a and b.

Run meiosis on this cell. At prophase I, one bivalent forms, containing the AB and ab homologs. If no crossover happens between the A locus and the B locus, the homologs separate at anaphase I exactly as they entered: the AB chromatids go to one daughter, the ab chromatids to the other. After meiosis II, the four gametes are two AB and two ab. Only the parental gamete types. No Ab, no aB. This is perfect linkage.

![Diagram comparing meiosis with no crossover (left) vs](images/01-meiosis-basis-of-inheritance-fig-05.png)
*Figure 1.5 — Diagram comparing meiosis with no crossover (left) vs*

If a crossover does happen between the A and B loci, the picture changes. A crossover is a physical exchange between non-sister chromatids of the two homologs, occurring during prophase I. The net effect: one chromatid of the AB chromosome trades its B region for the ab chromosome's b region, producing a recombinant Ab chromatid; symmetrically, the ab chromosome produces a recombinant aB chromatid. The bivalent now contains: one AB, one Ab, one aB, one ab chromatid. All four gamete types appear, in equal proportions, from this one meiosis.

Now average over many meioses. Let **r** be the fraction of meioses in which a crossover falls between the A and B loci — the **recombination frequency**. In the (1 − r) fraction of meioses without a crossover, only parental gametes appear. In the r fraction with a crossover, all four gamete types appear equally. The result:

- AB (parental): (1 − r)/2
- ab (parental): (1 − r)/2
- Ab (recombinant): r/2
- aB (recombinant): r/2

At r = 0, only parentals — perfect linkage. At r = 0.5, all four types in equal proportion — indistinguishable from independent assortment. At r = 0.20, parentals at 0.40 each and recombinants at 0.10 each — a 4:1 ratio of parental to recombinant gametes.

The insight Sturtevant had in 1913 is this: the recombination frequency r is a measure of physical distance along the chromosome. Two loci close together on a chromosome rarely have a crossover between them — not much DNA in the gap, so the chance a crossover lands there is low. Two loci far apart often have a crossover between them. Recombination frequency is a monotonically increasing function of physical distance. So you can build a map of the chromosome by measuring recombination frequencies between pairs of loci and arranging them in a linear order consistent with all the pairwise distances.

Sturtevant defined the unit: **1 centimorgan (cM) = 1% recombination frequency**. He then mapped six X-linked genes in *Drosophila* from their pairwise recombination frequencies, producing the first genetic linkage map of any chromosome. The technique he invented — measuring recombination frequencies to infer chromosomal positions — was the only way to map genes for the next sixty years.

![Sturtevant's method: measure r between every pair, find the linear order that makes the distances additive](images/01-meiosis-basis-of-inheritance-fig-06.png)
*Figure 1.6 — Schematic of a three-gene linkage map *

The move that matters. The chromosomal theory turned an *exception* to Mendel's Second Law into a *measurement device*. The cases where the law fails are exactly the cases where you can measure something the law assumed away — the physical architecture of the chromosome, the linear order of genes, the distances between them. The deviation, made quantitative, gives you the first geometric picture of the genome.

| chromosomal configuration | gamete proportions (AB : Ab : aB : ab) | testcross offspring ratio | what this looks like in data — |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1) different chromosomes | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| 2) same chromosome, no crossing over | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| 3) same chromosome, r = 0.20 | 0.40 | 0.10 | 0.10 |

## The X chromosome's special arithmetic

So far the chromosomal theory has been about chromosomes that are inherited symmetrically — each parent contributes one copy of each autosome to each offspring. But there is one chromosome that is not inherited symmetrically, and its asymmetry generates one of the most recognizable patterns in clinical genetics.

In humans, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y (XY). The Y carries fewer than 100 protein-coding genes, mostly involved in sex determination and sperm production. The X carries around 800 protein-coding genes doing ordinary cellular jobs — clotting factors, photopigments, structural muscle proteins — that have nothing to do with sex.

A gene on the X chromosome has a different inheritance pattern in males and females simply because males and females have different numbers of X chromosomes. A male who inherits a recessive allele on his single X has the disease. He has no second allele to mask it. A female who inherits one recessive allele is a carrier — heterozygous, phenotypically normal, but able to pass the allele to her children.

Morgan found the first evidence of this in May 1910. Among thousands of red-eyed *Drosophila* he had been breeding, a single white-eyed male appeared. Morgan crossed it with red-eyed females. The F₁ generation was uniformly red-eyed — consistent with white being recessive. He interbred F₁ flies and counted F₂. The 3:1 ratio appeared — but with a twist: every white-eyed F₂ fly was male. Not one female had white eyes.

The chromosomal theory had no explanation for this — unless the white-eye gene was on the X chromosome. If it was, the F₂ daughters could not be white-eyed in this cross, because their only source of the white allele was the F₁ mothers (X^+/X^w, heterozygous carriers), and the F₁ fathers had a wild-type X (X^+/Y). Every F₂ daughter inherited a wild-type X from her father. She could be at most a carrier — not affected. F₂ sons inherited a Y from their father and either the wild-type or the mutant X from their heterozygous mother. Half of them were white-eyed.

Morgan published this result in *Science* in July 1910 — three months after finding the original white-eyed fly. The prediction snapped precisely to the data. It was the first direct experimental confirmation that a specific gene resided on a specific chromosome.

Now the inheritance arithmetic of X-linked recessive disorders, made specific.

A carrier mother has genotype X^+/X^w — one wild-type X and one mutant X. In her oocytes, the two X chromosomes pair as a bivalent at prophase I and separate at anaphase I, just like any other chromosome pair. Half her eggs carry the wild-type X; half carry the mutant X. An unaffected father contributes either his X^+ or his Y. The four equally likely offspring genotypes from this cross:

- X^+ (from mother) + X^+ (from father) → daughter, non-carrier
- X^w (from mother) + X^+ (from father) → daughter, carrier
- X^+ (from mother) + Y (from father) → son, unaffected
- X^w (from mother) + Y (from father) → son, affected

The probabilities a genetic counselor gives to a couple in the consultation room — conditional on having a son, probability of disease is 1/2; conditional on having a daughter, probability of being a carrier is 1/2 — are the direct consequence of that anaphase I separation in the mother's meiosis.

![Pedigree diagram showing carrier mother (half-filled circle) ×](images/01-meiosis-basis-of-inheritance-fig-07.png)
*Figure 1.7 — Pedigree diagram showing carrier mother (half-filled circle) ×*

Two diagnostic features identify X-linked recessive inheritance in a pedigree.

**No father-to-son transmission.** Sons inherit a Y from their fathers, not an X. An affected father cannot pass an X-linked allele to a son. If you see an affected father with an affected son, the inheritance pattern is not X-linked recessive.

**Affected sons through carrier mothers.** The signature pattern is phenotypically normal females transmitting the disease to approximately half their sons, with daughters unaffected (but half being carriers). When you see affected males scattered across generations, transmitted through normal females, with no affected females and no father-to-son transmission, the diagnosis is confirmed.

Three real X-linked recessive disorders worth knowing:

**Hemophilia A** — mutations in *F8* (Xq28), encoding coagulation factor VIII. Affected males have impaired blood clotting. Incidence about 1 in 5,000 male births. The most famous pedigree: Queen Victoria was a carrier; her son Leopold had hemophilia; her daughters Alice and Beatrice were carriers; the allele spread through the royal houses of Russia, Spain, and Germany through her children's marriages.

**Red-green color blindness** — mutations in *OPN1LW* and *OPN1MW* (Xq28), the cone photopigment genes. Incidence about 8% of males, 0.5% of females in European populations — a 16× male excess, which is the diagnostic signature of X-linked recessive inheritance.

**Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)** — mutations in *DMD* (Xp21), encoding dystrophin. The *DMD* gene is the largest known human gene, spanning about 2.4 megabases (over 1% of the X chromosome). Its large size makes it an unusually large mutational target, so about 30% of DMD cases arise from new (de novo) mutations rather than being inherited from a carrier mother.

## Three randomization mechanisms, multiplied

Sexual reproduction generates genetic variation by three independent mechanisms operating at different points in meiosis. Each mechanism is a randomization. Together they multiply — and the multiplicative structure is the chapter's largest number.

**Mechanism 1: Independent assortment at metaphase I.** 23 chromosome pairs orienting independently — 2²³ = 8,388,608 distinct gamete types per human individual, before crossing over.

**Mechanism 2: Crossing over during prophase I.** Every human meiosis introduces approximately 50–200 reciprocal exchanges between non-sister chromatids of homologous pairs. Every chromosome has at least one crossover; most have several. Each crossover creates a recombinant chromatid carrying maternal sequence in some regions and paternal sequence in others. Two siblings' copies of chromosome 7 are different mosaics of the same parental sequences, with crossovers at different locations. The combinatorial space of possible recombinant chromatid configurations is not easy to compute exactly — but it turns the finite number of whole-chromosome combinations from independent assortment into a near-continuous space of possible chromosome sequences.

**Mechanism 3: Random fertilization.** Any sperm can fuse with any egg. For one couple, considering only independent assortment:

8,388,608 (distinct egg genotypes from the mother) × 8,388,608 (distinct sperm genotypes from the father) = **about 70 trillion possible zygote genotypes**

Before crossing over is considered. With crossing over, the number is effectively unbounded.

There have been roughly 100 billion humans in all of human history (10¹¹). The number of distinct zygote genotypes any one couple could produce — from independent assortment alone — exceeds the total number of humans who have ever lived by a factor of about 700. Considering crossing over, the excess is by many more orders of magnitude.

Now here is the thing about that number. Students very often try to *add* the three mechanisms: 8.4 million plus 8.4 million plus crossing-over diversity, totaling something large-ish. That is not the right operation. The mechanisms *multiply*, because they are independent: 8.4 million × 8.4 million × crossing-over diversity. The multiplication is what produces the 70-trillion figure for a single couple. And the multiplication comes from the fact that three physically separate randomization processes — one at metaphase I orientation, one at prophase I crossing over, one at fertilization — are composing with each other, not adding.

The consequence is the one that feels like philosophy but is arithmetic: two genetically identical full siblings (other than identical twins, who split from a single zygote) are not improbable — they are not possible in any practical sense. The statement "you have never existed before" is not poetry. It is the consequence of three independent coin-flip mechanisms multiplied through every meiosis and every fertilization in your ancestry.

## What the chromosomal theory actually explains

Step back and look at what Sutton's 1903 paper accomplished.

Mendel had, from breeding experiments alone, inferred three things: factors come in pairs; the pairs segregate cleanly into gametes; different pairs assort independently. He had no physical model — just the ratios of wrinkled peas and smooth peas, of yellow seeds and green seeds, counted in a monastery garden in Brno for eight years.

Sutton looked through a microscope and saw objects that behaved like those abstract factors in every verifiable respect. They came in pairs (parallel 1). They separated cleanly into gametes — one to each daughter cell at anaphase I (parallel 2). Different pairs oriented independently at metaphase I (parallel 3). Three parallels, all from cytology anyone with a microscope could reproduce.

But the chromosomal theory did more than confirm Mendel. It predicted something Mendel's framework could not even formulate — that there should be pairs of traits that *do not* assort independently, because their genes share a chromosome. When Morgan found exactly this, in *Drosophila* white-eye and yellow body color, both on the X chromosome, the chromosomal theory was not overturned. It was confirmed. The exception was the proof.

And then Sturtevant turned the exception into a measurement. Two linked genes that show 8% recombination are 8 centimorgans apart. Three genes with pairwise distances of 8, 5, and 13 centimorgans are in the order A–B–C. From recombination frequencies measured in breeding experiments, you can build a linear map of the genome — a physical picture of the chromosome — without ever directly looking at the DNA.

This is the pattern that good physical theories follow: they explain the known phenomena, they predict new ones, and the new phenomena, when confirmed, deepen rather than destroy the theory. The chromosomal theory explains Mendel's laws, predicts linkage, predicts X-linked inheritance patterns, and predicts the combinatorial explosion of sexual reproduction. Each prediction has been confirmed. The theory has been extended by molecular biology — we now know chromosomes are DNA, we know the molecular machinery of crossing over, we can sequence the genome letter by letter — but the core claim Sutton wrote in 1903 stands: *Mendel's factors are chromosomes; the inheritance pattern of any factor is the meiotic behavior of the chromosome carrying it.*

## LLM Exercise — Build your meiosis-and-Mendel simulator

This block is the one you actually do. The prompt below is ready to paste at Claude (or ChatGPT, or Gemini) once you have CLAUDE.md and DESIGN.md saved in the same folder from Chapter 00.

### The simulation prompt

```
Show: Read CLAUDE.md and DESIGN.md from this project. Conform to them.

Say: Build 01-meiosis-mendel.html — a meiosis-as-inheritance
simulator with two panels.

Panel 1 — Chromosomal Mendel. Animate one complete meiosis of a
heterozygous parent at one or two loci (A/a and B/b). The user
toggles among three modes:
  (a) "Different chromosomes" — A and B on separate chromosomes.
      Two bivalents form, orient independently at metaphase I, and
      separate at anaphase I. Show four equally likely orientations
      cycling through, and tally the gamete proportions.
  (b) "Same chromosome, no crossing over" — A and B on one
      chromosome in cis (AB/ab). One bivalent forms; at anaphase I,
      the AB homolog goes to one pole and the ab homolog to the
      other. Only AB and ab gametes are produced.
  (c) "Same chromosome, recombination frequency r" — slider for r
      (0.00 to 0.50, step 0.01, default 0.20). The simulation
      visually displays the bivalent at prophase I with crossover
      events occurring at frequency r between the A and B loci, and
      tallies the resulting gamete proportions: AB at (1-r)/2, ab
      at (1-r)/2, Ab at r/2, aB at r/2.

The gamete ratio is displayed as a bar chart (using D3, four bars,
labeled AB, Ab, aB, ab; bars colored by genotype class per
DESIGN.md). The readout panel displays:
- the current mode
- the current value of r (in mode c)
- the four gamete proportions
- the predicted F1 testcross offspring ratio (gamete ratio × ab
  tester)
- a PASS/FAIL line for the boundary cases: r = 0 should give
  1:0:0:1 (parentals only); r = 0.5 should give 1:1:1:1 (as if
  unlinked); intermediate r should give the (1-r)/2 : r/2 : r/2 :
  (1-r)/2 ratio matching the formula.

Panel 2 — X-linked-recessive pedigree generator. The user selects:
- The disease (dropdown: hemophilia A [F8], red-green color
  blindness [OPN1LW/OPN1MW], Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD],
  population frequency parameters built in for each).
- The genotype of the mother: dropdown of "non-carrier", "carrier",
  "affected" (rare).
- The genotype of the father: dropdown of "unaffected", "affected"
  (carries the recessive on his single X).
- Number of children to simulate (slider, 1 to 12, default 4).
- Sex of each child (drop-downs for each, default random).

The simulation displays the pedigree as a small tree (squares for
males, circles for females, filled = affected, half-filled = carrier
female, empty = unaffected), and prints the calculated probability
of each phenotype for each child given the parental genotypes:
- For carrier mother × unaffected father: 1/2 daughters carrier,
  1/2 daughters non-carrier, 1/2 sons affected, 1/2 sons unaffected.
- For affected father × non-carrier mother: all daughters carrier,
  no sons affected (no father-to-son transmission).
- For carrier mother × affected father: 1/2 daughters affected, 1/2
  daughters carrier, 1/2 sons affected, 1/2 sons unaffected.
- For non-carrier mother × unaffected father: no offspring at risk
  (except for new mutation, which the simulation ignores).

The readout panel includes a "diagnostic test" toggle that, when
enabled, displays the two pedigree-diagnosis criteria with a
PASS/FAIL: (1) no father-to-son transmission in the displayed
pedigree (PASS if no affected son has an affected father in the
pedigree); (2) affected sons through carrier mothers (PASS if every
affected son has a carrier mother in the pedigree).

Constrain: Two panels side by side; SVG canvas 720 x 480 per panel.

  (1) Panel 1, mode a (different chromosomes): gamete proportions
      must be {AB: 0.25, Ab: 0.25, aB: 0.25, ab: 0.25}, summing to 1.
  (2) Panel 1, mode b (perfect linkage): gamete proportions must be
      {AB: 0.5, Ab: 0, aB: 0, ab: 0.5}, summing to 1.
  (3) Panel 1, mode c, r = 0.20: gamete proportions must be
      {AB: 0.40, Ab: 0.10, aB: 0.10, ab: 0.40}, summing to 1.
  (4) Panel 1, mode c, r = 0.50: gamete proportions must equal mode
      a (1:1:1:1) to verify the boundary.
  (5) Panel 2, carrier mother × unaffected father: probability of
      affected son must be 0.25 (1/2 son × 1/2 mutant X), affected
      daughter must be 0 (under default rare-disease assumption);
      carrier daughter must be 0.25.
  (6) Panel 2, affected father × non-carrier mother: all daughters
      must be carriers (P = 0.5 per pregnancy), no sons affected
      (P = 0 per pregnancy) — verifying no father-to-son
      transmission.

### Exploration tasks

Once the simulation runs:

1. **The linkage spectrum.** Set Panel 1 to mode c. Step r through 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50. At each step, write down the four gamete proportions and the predicted testcross offspring ratio. At r = 0, the ratio collapses to 1:1 (parentals only). At r = 0.5, it expands to 1:1:1:1. Plot the predicted offspring ratio as a function of r — you will see the parental-recombinant divergence shrink continuously as r approaches 0.5. This is the experimentally measurable curve Sturtevant used in 1913 to build the first chromosome map.

2. **The pedigree diagnostic.** Set Panel 2 to "color blindness," with the mother as carrier and the father as affected. Generate 12 children. Note that some affected daughters now appear. Run the diagnostic check — *no father-to-son transmission* should still pass, because sons get a Y from the father, not the recessive X. This is the move that distinguishes X-linked recessive from autosomal recessive in a pedigree.

3. **A historical case.** Set Panel 2 to "hemophilia A," with the mother as carrier and the father as unaffected. Generate 9 children. Compare the expected outcomes to Queen Victoria's pedigree — she had nine children, of whom one son (Leopold) was affected and at least two daughters (Alice and Beatrice) were carriers. The simulation should produce a similar distribution on average, though any individual run will fluctuate. This is the same statistical sampling issue that would have masked the chromosome-4 linkage in Mendel's crosses if he had used small sample sizes.

### Extension prompt

```
Extension: Modify 01-meiosis-mendel.html so that Panel 1's bivalent
animation shows the full meiotic choreography in five animated
phases:
  (a) Prophase I — show the two homologous chromosomes pairing
      along their length (synaptonemal complex implied as a thin
      central line). One crossover event per bivalent is drawn as a
      visible exchange between two non-sister chromatids at a
      random position along the length, weighted by r so that the
      crossover lands between the A and B loci with probability r.
  (b) Metaphase I — the bivalent aligns at the cell equator,
      attached to spindle microtubules from opposite poles.
  (c) Anaphase I — homologs separate; one goes to each pole.
      Sister chromatids remain joined at the centromere.
  (d) Telophase I — two haploid daughter cells form, each with one
      homolog of two sister chromatids.
  (e) Meiosis II — sister chromatids separate in each daughter;
      four gametes result, each colored by genotype class.
The animation cycles continuously; the user can pause, step
through, or restart. Each frame is annotated with the phase name
and the chromosomal event.

The ideas in this chapter didn't appear from nowhere. **Walter Sutton** published his chromosomal theory of inheritance in 1902 and 1903 — a twenty-four-year-old graduate student connecting Mendel's abstract factors to the chromosomes he could see through his microscope. He was working on his master's thesis.

**Run this:**

```
Who was Walter Sutton, and how does his observation of grasshopper
chromosomes connect to Mendel's laws of inheritance? Keep it to
three paragraphs. End with the single most surprising thing about
his career or ideas.
```

→ Search **"Walter Sutton geneticist"** on Wikipedia. See what the model got right, got wrong, or left out.

**Now make the prompt better.** Try one of these:

- Ask it to explain the three parallels between chromosome behavior and Mendel's factors that Sutton identified in his 1903 paper.
- Ask it to compare Sutton's contribution to Boveri's independent work — what each saw, and why the combination of the two perspectives was more convincing than either alone.

What changes? What gets better? What gets worse?
